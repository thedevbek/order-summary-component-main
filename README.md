## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm learning how to write semantic code, but sometimes you just need to add a div like I did to contain the content to make it seprate from the body. I am getting better with CSS and Tailwind CSS. 


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The documenation of Tailwind CSS is written really well.
